Broth
-----

This is broth, the mother of all soups.

A simple high-level script used to generate Ubuntu based live distros
using the Debian-Live framework.

Broth is at the moment focussing on producing Puredyne live images but
it can be used for virtually any other live systems.


Documentation
-------------
FIXME
depends:

live-helper from snapshots: http://live.debian.net/archive/packages/live-helper/ (latest snapshot recommended)
live-helper 1.0.5 as found in Ubuntu Karmic won't work, unless you replace 'lh foo' by 'lh_foo' in broth.sh - newer lh version recommended

debootstrap-1.0.20 or higher


Usage

./broth -o CD|DVD

and have a few coffees and loads of biscuits. It takes a long time, esp. the first time.
