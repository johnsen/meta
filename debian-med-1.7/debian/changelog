debian-med (1.6) unstable; urgency=low

    preceding whitespace. [Policy paragraph 5.2]
  * debhelper (>=7)
  * Added med-statistics
  * tasks/bio: Replaced biococoa.app by sequenceconverter.app

  * Build-Depends: blends-dev (0.6.3) to make sure no useless
    metapackages with no dependency available in Debian will be

    also supports dist experimental
  * Adapted Vcs fields to new location (cdd -> blends)
  * tasks/practice: Depends: aeskulap
  * Added link to tasks page in long description of med-tasks
    (thanks to James Busser <jbusser@interchange.ubc.ca> for the

debian-med (1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * tasks/bio-dev
    - Added libgenome
    - Added libmems as prospective package
    - Moved bioconductor from bio to bio-dev
    - Added prospective projects where Steffen Möller started some
      packaging work
    - libqsearch -> libqsearch-dev
  * tasks/bio
    - Added prospective projects where Steffen Möller started some
      packaging work
    - Suggests: texlive-latex-extra (because of TeXShade)
    - Removed line breaks in Dependencies, because cdd-gen-control
      is not compliant to RFC 822 and requires '\' at the end of
      lines to continue parsing the tasks files.  To simply circumvent
      this problem the relevant lines were concatenated to not miss
      the dependencies in the resulting control file
    - Renamed dialign-t to dialign-tx
  * tasks/tools
    - Added mssstest
    - Added wgerman-medical, hunspell-de-med (remark: these are not
      really tools but we have no better section, typesetting might be
      an option but does also fit not really good)
  * tasks/imaging
    - Added prospective packages from static page
  * tasks/imaging-dev
    - Removed libgtkimreg
    - Added libvtk5
    - Added prospective packages from static page

  * Standards-Version: 3.8.0 (no changes needed)
  * Fixed typing of Debian Med: sed -i 's/Debian-Med/Debian Med/' *

 -- Andreas Tille <tille@debian.org>  Mon, 30 Jun 2008 09:59:37 +0200

debian-med (0.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * tasks/bio:
    - Added emboss-kaptain as prospective package
    - Added agdbnet as prospective package
    - Added autodock, exonerate
    - Suggests biococoa.app: Only suggests because status is
      questionable
    - Removed bugsx which is not really biology related
    - Added gamgi as prospective package
    - Moved unoffical and prospective packages from static
      web pages to tasks file

    - Added aceperl as prospective package
    - Added libgff-perl as prospective package
    - Added Recommends: libqsearch

    research
  * tasks/tools:
    - Moved NetEpi prospective package to epi where it really
      belongs to
    - Added pondus
  * Removed remark about recommended and suggested packages
    from description or meta packages
  * Build-Depends-Indep: cdd-dev (>= 0.5.0) which ensures that the
    source tarball is builded properly and no network access is neede
    to build the package
    Closes: #470271

 -- Andreas Tille <tille@debian.org>  Wed, 20 Feb 2008 13:31:25 +0100

debian-med (0.16) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
  * Standards-Version: 3.7.3 (no changes needed)
  * Added Vcs-Browser / Vcs-Svn tags
  * tasks/imaging:
    - Added Dr. Jekyll, libvista2 and dcm4che as prospective package
    - Fixed minc and nifti library depends
    - odin, gwyddion and many more as prospective package
    - Removed libfslio1, libniftiio0 which are only available in Etch
    - Suggests: Imview
  * tasks/imaging-dev:
    - libvista2-dev as prospective package
    - Fixed minc-dev and nifti-dev library depends
    - Removed libniftiio0-dev which is only available in Etch
  * tasks/bio
    - Added ballview and mustang as prospective packages
    - dialign-t is now official package - removed long
      description

  * tasks/bio-dev: Added BioClipse as prospective package
    Pkg-Description
  * tasks/practice:
    - Added Mirth as prospective package
    - Fixed libchipcard depends
  * Debian-Med packaging policy:
    - Maintainer: Debian-Med Packaging Team
      <debian-med-packaging@lists.alioth.debian.org>
    - XS-DM-Upload-Allowed: yes
    - Uploaders: Andreas Tille <tille@debian.org>
    - Vcs-Browser, Vcs-Svn
  * Increased mozilla-biofox from Suggests to Recommends. Installation of
    firefox as Dependency of this package should be no real problem.
  * Increased bugsx from Suggests to Recommends.  It is automatically decreased
    to Suggests by cdd-gen-control so there is no need to decrease it in the
    tasks file.
  * Make tasks files compliant with rfc822 to be able to use python-debian
    tools successfully.  That means basically to have exactly one
    Depends/Recommends/Suggest per paragraph so the fix was to insert some
    newlines and remove '\' in end of lines
  * tasks/tools: Fixed description
  * tasks/practice: tinyheb as prospective package
  * Increased Build-Dep version cdd-dev (>= 0.4.7) because
    0.4.5 and 0.4.6 are broken
  * config/control: med-config Depends cdd-common (>= 0.4.7)

    Depends: libinsighttoolkit-dev
    Suggests: insighttoolkit-examples
  * med-imaging(-dev): Depend from libniftiio1(-dev) instead of
    libniftiio0(-dev)
    Closes: #448903
  * Increased Build-Dep version cdd-dev (>= 0.4.4)
  * Standards-Version: 3.7.3 (no changes needed)
  * Added several prospective packages in tasks

 -- Andreas Tille <tille@debian.org>  Sun, 07 Oct 2007 18:25:56 +0200

debian-med (0.14) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Andreas Tille <tille@debian.org>  Sat, 11 Aug 2007 17:50:29 +0200

debian-med (0.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed entry for gnumed-client-debug because this package does
    not exist any more.  Removed gnumed-client menu as well because
    this should be builded automatically from menu entry inside
    gnumed-client package
    Closes: #429217
  * Added several packages to med-bio and reordering the task to
    specific fields
  * Imaging: Added dicomnifti
  * Enhanced long description of med-common
  * Remove header from po.stub/de.po because cdd-dev will add another
    one

 -- Andreas Tille <tille@debian.org>  Thu, 28 Jun 2007 16:23:36 +0200

debian-med (0.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed med-practice menu
    Closes: #385584
    Use menu entry for gnumed-client-debug that regards #389932.
    Note: gnumed-client-debug is not in the med-practice dependency
    list but it is suggested by gnumed-client.  So *if* the package
    is installed at the box then an additional menu item occures correctly
    in the Debian-Med menu.  If it is not installed, only gnumed-client
    is shown in the menu.
  * med-bio: Added alternative to tree-puzzle as tree-ppuzzle
  * Drop med-dent because odontolinux was removed from Debian
  * med-bio: Added poa
             Moved vrom Suggests to Depends: seaview (now really free)
             Suggests: wise-doc
  * med-imaging: Depends: libfslio0, libniftiio0, nifti-bin
                 Suggests: 
  * med-imaging-dev: Depends: libfslio0-dev, libniftiio0-dev
                     Suggests: libnifti-doc

debian-med (0.11) unstable; urgency=low

    Closes: #383265
  * Standards-Version: 3.7.2
    Build-Depends: debhelper
  * med-bio:
      Depends: gromacs, dialign, kalign, probcons, wise, amap-align, biosquid

  * debian/compat: 5
  * Uploaders: Debian-Med Packaging Team <debian-med-packaging@lists.alioth.debian.org>
  
 -- Andreas Tille <tille@debian.org>  Wed, 16 Aug 2006 10:07:41 +0200

debian-med (0.10.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make med-common depend from ${misc:Depends}
    Closes: #331797
  * Now med-practice really depends from gnumed-client which is now
    awailable at Debian mirror

 -- Andreas Tille <tille@debian.org>  Wed,  5 Oct 2005 07:55:13 +0200

debian-med (0.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rebuilded with cdd-dev 0.3.11 (and increased versioned dependency
    because 0.3.10 created broken *.dsc file)
    Closes: #328428
  * Standards-Version: 3.6.2 (no changes necessary)
  * Added dependencies:
    med-bio:     mipe, sim4, perlprimer

debian-med (0.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed gnutrion from tools because it was removed from Debian at all
  * Rebuilded with cdd-dev 0.3.10 version
  * med-bio: 
     Depends: muscle, gff2aplot, t-coffee, gff2ps, gdpc
     Suggests: arb
  * med-bio-dev
     Recommends: libvibrant6-dev
     Why: libmotif-dev conflicts lesstif-dev, so if someone wants to
          install libmotif-dev it must be possible to deinstall
	  libvibrant6-dev without beeing forced to deinstall med-bio-dev
	  as well
     Depends: python-biopython
  * med-imaging:
     paul now Recommends not Depends
     Depends: dcmtk
     Recommends: pngquant
  * med-tools: 
     Depends: cycle
     Suggests: cl-pubmed
               Strong dependency would cost installing a large amount
	       of Common Lisp tools which in most cases is not worth
	       the effort
  * Added user menu entries: bio/gff2aplot.txt, bio/gff2ps.txt,
    bio/muscle.txt, bio/t-coffee.txt, bio/boxshade.txt,
    bio-dev/python-biopython.txt, imaging/dcmtk.txt

debian-med (0.8.3) unstable; urgency=high

  * Rebuilded again against cdd-dev 0.3.4 which really closes the
    mentioned bug.
  * Urgency set to high because it *really* fixes a grave bug.

 -- Andreas Tille <tille@debian.org>  Thu, 15 Jul 2004 10:59:25 +0200

debian-med (0.8.2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Rebuilded with cdd-dev 0.3.3 which closes a grave bug (which
    was reassigned to cdd-dev and thus it is not closed in this
    changelog).
  * Please make sure that all ${HOME}/.menu/cdd-menu files or
    ${HOME}/.menu/med-* files are removed - they will not be
    needed any more.

 -- Andreas Tille <tille@debian.org>  Wed, 14 Jul 2004 21:42:24 +0200

 -- Andreas Tille <tille@debian.org>  Fri,  4 Jun 2004 14:44:36 +0200

debian-med (0.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Switched to new version of cdd package (0.3) which has many
    enhancements (no really important changes to the Debian-Med stuff
    except that the packages have to be rebuilded with cdd-dev).
  * New cdd-dev package cares for versioned dependency on med-common
    Closes: #244903

 -- Andreas Tille <tille@debian.org>  Tue, 20 Apr 2004 11:21:16 +0200

debian-med (0.6) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Took over Debian-Edu method to build metapackages from one
    common source.
    The changelogs of the previous single meta package sources
    can be found in the source package under debian/oldchangelogs.
