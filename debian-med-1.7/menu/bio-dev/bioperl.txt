Bioperl: Perl tools for computational molecular biology

Some information about Bioperl from the Debian Med project.

 The Bioperl project is a coordinated effort to collect computational methods
 routinely used in bioinformatics into a set of standard CPAN-style,
 well-documented, and freely available Perl modules.

The Homepage is http://bio.perl.org/

You can get a good overview by the main manpage:

       man bioperl
