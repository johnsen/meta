BioMode: Emacs mode to edit genetic data

Some information about Biomode from the Debian Med project.

    It provides you several interesting commands to take the antiparallel
    of a region, convert it using readseq, runs blast on it, etc.

This package is not really installed by the med-bio package but it is
suggested.  That means if you are comfortable with the powerful editor
Emacs you might wish to install also the biomode package and make use
of it by typing "M-x biomode".
