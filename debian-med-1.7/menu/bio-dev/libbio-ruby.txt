BioRuby tools for computational molecular biology

Some information about libbio-ruby from the Debian Med project.

 BioRuby project aims to implement an integrated environment for
 Bioinformatics with Ruby language. Design philosophy of the BioRuby library
 is KISS (keep it simple and stupid) to maximize the usability and the
 efficiency for biologists as a daily tool. The project was started in Japan
 and supported by University of Tokyo (Human Genome Center), Kyoto University
 (Bioinformatics Center) and the Open Bio Foundation.
