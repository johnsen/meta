Python library for bioinformatics

Some information about python-biopython from the Debian Med project.

 The Biopython Project is an international association
 of developers of freely available Python tools for
 computational molecular biology.
 
 It is a distributed collaborative effort to develop Python
 libraries and applications which address the needs of
 current and future work in bioinformatics. The source code
 is made available under the Biopython License, which is
 extremely liberal and compatible with almost every license
 in the world. We work along with the Open Bioinformatics
 Foundation, who generously provide web and CVS space for
 the project.
