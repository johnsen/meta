Tigr Glimmer: Gene detection in archea and bacteria

Some information about tigr-glimmer from the Debian Med project.

 Developed by the TIGR institute this software detects coding sequences in
 bacteria and archea.
 
 Glimmer is a system for finding genes in microbial DNA, especially the
 genomes of bacteria and archaea. Glimmer (Gene Locator and Interpolated
 Markov Modeler) uses interpolated Markov models (IMMs) to identify the
 coding regions and distinguish them from noncoding DNA.

An overview about the various tools are given by the following manpages:

     man glimmer2      (start with this)
     man build-icm
     man extract
     man long-orfs
     
More or less simple syntax help without detailed information is given by

     man adjust
     man anomaly
     man check
     man codon-usage
     man compare-lists
     man generate
     man get-len
     man run-glimmer2
     man get-putative
