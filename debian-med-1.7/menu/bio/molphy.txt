Some information about MolPhy from the Debian Med project.

Molphy is an extensive set of tools for MOLecular PHYlogenetics.  You can
get a first overview by the two manpages

   man protml
   man mollist

For further reading the files in 

   /usr/share/doc/molphy

are suggested.  Moreover you can find several examples in

   /usr/share/doc/molphy/examples/tests/

which contains a makefile to give you an idea how to call the MolPhy tools.
