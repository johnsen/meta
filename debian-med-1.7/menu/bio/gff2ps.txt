Produce PostScript graphical output from GFF-files

Some information about gff2ps from the Debian Med project.

 gff2ps is a script program developed with the aim of converting gff-formatted
 records into high quality one-dimensional plots in PostScript. Such plots
 maybe useful for comparing genomic structures and to visualizing outputs from
 genome annotation programs.
 It can be used in a very simple way, because it assumes that the GFF file
 itself carries enough formatting information, but it also allows through a
 number of options and/or a configuration file, for a great degree of
 customization.
