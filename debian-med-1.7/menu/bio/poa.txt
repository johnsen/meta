Partial Order Alignment for multiple sequence alignment

Some information about t-coffee from the Debian Med project.

 POA is Partial Order Alignment, a fast program for multiple sequence
 alignment (MSA) in bioinformatics. Its advantages are speed,
 scalability, sensitivity, and the superior ability to handle branching
 / indels in the alignment. Partial order alignment is an approach to
 MSA, which can be combined with existing methods such as progressive
 alignment. POA optimally aligns a pair of MSAs and which therefore can
 be applied directly to progressive alignment methods such as CLUSTAL.
 For large alignments, Progressive POA is 10-30 times faster than
 CLUSTALW. POA is published in Bioinformatics. 2004 Jul
 10;20(10):1546-56.
