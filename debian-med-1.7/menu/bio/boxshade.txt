Pretty-printing of multiple sequence alignments

Some information about boxshade from the Debian Med project.

 Boxshade reads a sequence alignment as input (e.g. from ClustalW) and
 outputs files that may be incorporated to text processing software
 (TeX via xfig, Word and OpenOffice via RTF). The post script format
 is also supported.
