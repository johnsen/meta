<h2>FastDNAml: Construction of Phylogenetic Trees</h2>

<h3>Some information about fastDNAml from the Debian Med project.</h3>

<h4>fastdnaml provides tools for construction of phylogenetic trees of DNA sequences</h4>

<quote>
 fastDNAml is a program derived from Joseph Felsenstein's version 3.3 DNAML
 (part of his PHYLIP package).  Users should consult the documentation for
 DNAML before using this program.
 fastDNAml is an attempt to solve the same problem as DNAML, but to do so
 faster and using less memory, so that larger trees and/or more bootstrap
 replicates become tractable.  Much of fastDNAml is merely a recoding of the
 PHYLIP 3.3 DNAML program from PASCAL to C.
