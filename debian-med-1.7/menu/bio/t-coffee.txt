Multiple Sequence Alignment

Some information about t-coffee from the Debian Med project.

 T-Coffee is a multiple sequence alignment package. Given a set of
 sequences (Proteins or DNA), T-Coffee generates a multiple sequence
 alignment. Version 2.00 and higher can mix sequences and structures.
 
 T-Coffee allows the combination of a collection of multiple/pairwise,
 global or local alignments into a single model. It also allows to
 estimate the level of consistency of each position within the new
 alignment with the rest of the alignments. See the pre-print for more
 information
