NCBI-EPCR: Tool to test a DNA sequence for the presence of sequence tagged sites

Some information about NCBI-Tools-Bin from the Debian Med project.

 Electronic PCR feature to test a DNA sequence for the presence of
 sequence tagged sites. e-PCR looks for STSs in DNA sequences by
 searching for subsequences that closely match the PCR primers and have
 the correct order, orientation, and spacing that they could plausibly
 prime the amplification of a PCR product of the correct molecular weight
 (Schuler, Genome Research 7:541-50, 1997).
