Some information about Phylip from the Debian Med project.

  A package of programs for inferring phylogenies.

  The PHYLogeny Inference Package is a package of programs for inferring
  phylogenies (evolutionary trees) from sequences.
  Methods that are available in the package include parsimony, distance
  matrix, and likelihood methods, including bootstrapping and consensus
  trees. Data types that can be handled include molecular sequences, gene
  frequencies, restriction sites, distance matrices, and 0/1 discrete
  characters.

If you call phylip in a text console you get some help:

 Usage: /usr/bin/phylip <program>
   Existing programs are:
 clique	  dnacomp   dnamlk    dollop	drawtree  kitsch    penny     retree
 consense  dnadist   dnamove   dolmove	factor	  mix	    protdist  seqboot
 contml	  dnainvar  dnapars   dolpenny	fitch	  move	    protpars
 contrast  dnaml     dnapenny  drawgram	gendist   neighbor  restml

which is quite the same information as the Debian manpage of phylip
contains.
There is extensive documentation at /usr/share/doc/phylip and some
examples in the examples dir at this location.
