r-cran-qtl: GNU R package for genetic marker linkage analysis

Some information about r-cran-qtl from the Debian Med project.

 R/qtl is an extensible, interactive environment for
 mapping quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in experimental crosses. It is
 implemented as an add-on-package for the freely available and widely used
 statistical language/software R (see http://www.r-project.org). The
 user will benefit from the seamless integration of the QTL mapping
 software into a general statistical analysis program.

 The current version of R/qtl includes facilities for estimating
 genetic maps, identifying genotyping errors, and performing single-QTL
 genome scans and two-QTL, two-dimensional genome scans, by interval
 mapping (with EM algorithm), Haley-Knott regression, and multiple
 imputation. All of this may be done in the presence of covariates
 (such as sex, age or treatment). The fit of higher-order QTL models,
 with sophisticated techniques for model comparisons and model search,
 will be incorporated soon.
