Loki: MCMC linkage analysis on general pedigrees

Some information about Loki from the Debian Med project.

 Performs Markov chain Monte Carlo multipoint linkage analysis on large,
 complex pedigrees.  The current package supports analyses on quantitative
 traits only, although this restriction will be lifted in later versions.
 Joint estimation of QTL number, position and effects uses Reversible Jump
 MCMC. It is also possible to perform affected only IBD sharing analyses.
