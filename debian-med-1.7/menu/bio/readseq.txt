ReadSeq: Conversion between sequence formats

Some information about readseq from the Debian Med project.

   Reads and writes nucleic/protein sequences in various formats. Data
   files may have multiple sequences.  Readseq is particularly useful as it
   automatically detects many sequence formats, and converts between them.
   
Please read the manual for this program by

   man readseq
   
To test the program you could also test the examples under 

   /usr/share/doc/readseq/tests
 
using the provided Makefile.
