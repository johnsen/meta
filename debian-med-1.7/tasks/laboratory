Task: Laboratory
Description: Debian Med suggestions for medical laboratories
 Currently Debian Med does not yet contain any software which is
 specifically intended to run a medical laboratory.  We just provide a
 list of Free Software that might be used and which might be included
 into Debian at a later point in time provided somebody is willing to
 take over the packaging work.

Pkg-Description: Enterprise Laboratory Information System
 OpenELIS is a robust Enterprise Laboratory Information System built around an
 extensible and scalable framework. OpenELIS is designed and developed through
 the collaborative efforts of Public Health Laboratories to accommodate
 business processes that are common to all public health laboratories;
 encompassing clinical, environmental, newborn screening, and animal testing.
 .
 The goal of the OpenELIS team is to develop a state of the art system that
 is economically sustainable by reducing both initial investment and ongoing
 maintenance costs. By using an open source approach, we ensure that the project
 will continue to evolve and meet the changing needs of the community.
