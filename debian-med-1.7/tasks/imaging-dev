Pkg-Description: software environment for computer vision research
 Vista is a software environment for computer vision research. It is
 designed to support not only images, but also edge sets, camera models,
 and more complex  data structures. Vista includes libraries of common
 computer vision and image  processing algorithms. It is written in
 ANSI C, for UNIX platforms running X Windows, and it is freely available.
 The original development was done  at University of British Columbia
 (http://www.cs.ubc.ca/nest/lci/vista/vista.html).
 .
 Because the development was stalled by the original authors the
 development continued in the "Tools for Medical Image Analysis"
 framework (http://mia.sourceforge.net/) which is maintained by
 Max Planck Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience
 (http://www.cns.mpg.de/).
 .
 This is the development package.
Remark: With libvia-dev an alternative is already part of Debian.
