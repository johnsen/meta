Task: Hospital Information Systems
Description: Debian Med suggestions for Hospital Information Systems
 Currently Debian Med does not yet contain any software which can be
 regarded as Hospital Information System.  There is some Free Software
 out there which might be interesting targets for inclusion into Debian
 and so we provide a list of these projects which might be included
 at a later point in time provided somebody is willing to take over
 the packaging work.

Pkg-Description: Database Engine with Extreme Scalability and Robustness
 GT.M is a database engine with scalability proven in large real-time
 transaction processing systems that have thousands of concurrent
 users, individual database file sizes to the Terabyte range (with
 virtually unlimited aggregate database sizes).  Yet the light
 footprint of GT.M allows it to also scale down for use in small
 applications and software appliances (virtual machines).
 .
 The GT.M data model is hierarchical associative memory (i.e.,
 multi-dimensional array) that imposes no restrictions on the data
 types of the indexes or content - the application logic can impose
 any schema, dictionary or data organization suited to its problem
 domain.  (Database engines that do not impose schemas, but which
 allow layered application software to impose and use whatever schema
 that is appropriate to the application are popularly referred to as
 "document oriented", "schemaless" or "schema-free" databases.)
 .
 GT.M's compiler for the standard M (also known as MUMPS) scripting
 language implements full support for ACID (Atomic, Consistent,
 Isolated, Durable) transactions, using optimistic concurrency control
 and software transactional memory (STM) that resolves the common
 mismatch between databases and programming languages. Its unique
 ability to create and deploy logical multi-site configurations of
 applications provides unrivaled continuity of business in the face of
 not just unplanned events, but also planned events, including planned
 events that include changes to application logic and schema.
 .
 Community support forums for GT.M can be found at
 http://sourceforge.net/projects/fis-gtm and support with assured
 service levels on commercial terms can be purchased from
 gtmsupport@fnis.com.

Pkg-Description: repackage and extended version of VistA produced by WorldVistA
 Developed by WorldVistA (http://worldvista.org) and released under GPL
 v2, WorldVistA EHR is a repackaged and extended version of the VistA
 health care information system (HIS) developed by the US Department of
 Veterans Affairs, and in the public domain through the US Freedom of
 Information Act.
 .
 WorldVistA successfully submitted WorldVistA EHR for certification by
 CCHIT (http://cchit.org) in 2007.  WorldVistA EHR VOE/ 1.0 was tested
 and passed inspection of 100 percent of a set of criteria for
 functionality (ability to create and manage electronic records for all
 patients, as well as automating workflow in a physician's office),
 interoperability (a first step in the ability to receive and send
 electronic data to other entities such as laboratories), and security
 (ability to keep patients' information safe).

Pkg-Description: electronic medical record system platform
 The software's mission is to help the fight against HIV/AIDS,
 multi-drug resistant tuberculosis, malaria, and related health crises.
 It is a common framework upon which medical informatics efforts in
 developing countries can be built.  The system is designed to be usable
 in very resource poor environments and can be modified with the addition
 of new data items, forms and reports without programming. 
 .
 The package is both just a library of API calls and a database and a
 default implementation of those API calls in the form of a web
 application.
 .
 OpenMRS is mature software. It is based upon a program which has been
 used effectively for over 30 years at Regenstrief Institute. It is
 currently implemented in Kenya, Rwanda, South Africa, Pakistan, Uganda,
 Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Malawi, Phillipines,Peru, Haiti, and other
 countries.
 .
 Features include:
  * Backed by a data model driven by a concept dictionary
  * Includes tools for data export and reporting
  * Versions exist for HIV/AIDS, Drug resistant TB, primary care and oncology
  * Supports open standards for medical data exchange including HL7, LOINC and IXF
  * Modular construction
