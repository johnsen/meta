 ANSI C, for UNIX platforms running X Windows, and it is freely available.
 The original development was done  at University of British Columbia
 (http://www.cs.ubc.ca/nest/lci/vista/vista.html).
 .
 Because the development was stalled by the original authors the
 development continued in the "Tools for Medical Image Analysis"

 At the core of the dcm4che project is a robust implementation of the
 DICOM standard. The dcm4che-1.x DICOM toolkit is used in many production
 applications across the world, while the current (2.x) version of the
 toolkit has been re-architected for high performance and flexibility.
 .
 Also contained within the dcm4che project is dcm4chee (the extra 'e'
 stands for 'enterprise'). dcm4chee is an Image Manager/Image Archive
 (according to IHE). The application contains the DICOM, HL7 services
 and interfaces that are required to provide storage, retrieval, and
 workflow to a healthcare environment. dcm4chee is pre-packaged and
 deployed within the JBoss application server. By taking advantage of
 many JBoss features (JMS, EJB, Servlet Engine, etc.), and assuming the
 role of several IHE actors for the sake of interoperability, the
 application provides many robust and scalable services.

Pkg-Description: IHE Test Software for Radiology
 The MESA software release which is available at
 http://ihedoc.wustl.edu/mesasoftware/10.15.0/dist/ provides several
 tools that might cover a wide range of applications for
 Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) testing.
 .
 Another important element of the IHE testing process is the set of
 software tools HIMSS and RSNA have commissioned. Developed by the
 Electronic Radiology Laboratory at the Mallinckrodt Institute of
 Radiology, Washington University of St. Louis, the MESA tools are
 designed for use by participating companies in implementing IHE
 capabilities in their systems and preparing for the Connectathon. Their
 purpose is to provide communication partners, test data and test plans
 to allow organizations to provide a baseline level of testing as they
 implement the IHE Technical Framework. These tools are made available to
 participants during the period of an IHE demonstration year and are then
 released into the public domain at the end of that cycle. The latest
 version of the MESA Test Tools available in the public domain can be
 found here.
 .
 This kind of software is definitively valuable for information systems
 vendors and imaging systems vendors.
 .
 Because the CTN Debian package is based on an upstream dead project
 these tools should have a high priority for packaging because the
 CTN homepage http://erl.wustl.edu/research/dicom/ctn.html says:
 "The CTN software is also embedded within the MESA tools. The version
 of CTN software in those tools does not have a separate release number
 but is more current than version 3.0.6."

Pkg-Description: API to DICOM in C# for Mono
 The openDICOM.NET project implements a new approach towards DICOM
 (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) libraries. DICOM is
 a worldwide standard in Medical IT and is provided by the National
 Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA). This standard specifies
 the way medical images and meta data like study or patient related
 data is stored and communicated over different digital medias. Thus,
 DICOM is a binary protocol and data format.
 .
 The openDICOM# Class Library, main part of the openDICOM.NET project,
 provides an API to DICOM in C# for Mono and the .NET Framework. It is
 a completely new implementation of DICOM. In contrast to other
 similar libraries the intention of this implementation is to provide
 a clean classification with support of unidirectional DICOM data
 streaming. Another implemented goal is the support of DICOM as
 XML. This is not standard conform but very use- and powerful within
 software development, storage and manipulation. Currently, full read
 support of DICOM output stream and full write support to XML is
 supposed to be provided. The entire DICOM content can be accessed as
 sequence or as tree of class instances. Latter is the default
 representation of DICOM content by the library.
 .
 The openDICOM.NET Utils are a collection of console tools for working
 with the needed data dictionaries in different data formats (binary
 and textual), query of ACR-NEMA (prior DICOM standard) and DICOM
 files and transcoding them into image formats like JPEG and XML
 files. These utils are written in C# for Mono and the .NET Framework
 and are using the openDICOM# API for processing.
 .
 The openDICOM.NET Navigator recapitulates the openDICOM.NET Utils in
 form of a GTK# GUI. It provides different views with focus on DICOM
 data sets and visualization. Connectivity to GIMP is also given for
 single image processing purpose as well as the possibility to run
 through multi-frame images like a movie.
 .
 The openDICOM.NET Beagle Filter Plugin increases the usability of
 ACR-NEMA and DICOM query within your desktop. It makes DICOM content
 overall indexable for retrieval. The Beagle search engine relies on
 Mono/.NET and works in the background of your system, but is able to
 detect content changes in realtime (depending on your configuration).
 .
 All GUI applications focus the popular GNOME desktop, but are 100%
 platform independent by relying on Mono.

Pkg-Description: convert scanned electrocardiograms into PNG format
 This program is designed to convert scanned 12-lead
 electrocardiograms into PNG format and a web-friendly image size. It
 assumes that the electrocardiogram (ECG) is printed with a black line
 on white paper with a red grid.
 .
 The problems this program is designed to solve are (1) an ECG scanned
 at relatively high resolution (300 to 600 dots per inch) imposes a
 substantial load on the web browser because it contains about 6
 million pixels which may require 18 to 24 MB of RAM to store for
 display. Also, (2) typical scanners convert a clean paper ECG into a
 multitude of colors, include green and blue. The resulting file
 cannot be compressed efficiently because it does not contain as much
 redundancy, and thus takes more time to transmit over low-speed
 network connections.

Remark: About packaging status the authors said:
 See the thread on the Debian Med mailing list at:
 http://lists.debian.org/debian-med/2009/04/msg00059.html
  - We've been working to get rid of, or replace, any remaining
    non-DFSG licensed plugins, but there's at least one left.
    The bug for tracking this is here:
      http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de/cgi-bin/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=19
  - At the moment Fiji depends on sun-java6 rather than openjdk.
  - The packages are rather large at the moment (about 35MiB).
    This is mostly due to bundling various components with Fiji
    that could be satisfied as dependencies in Debian, such as
    junit, jruby, etc. but I haven't had time to work on
    separating those out.
  - Fiji uses a modified version of ImageJA (which again is
    bundled into the fiji package) rather than depending on the
    imagej Debian package created by people on this list.
  - One of the aims of Fiji was to make Benjamin Schmid's
    Java3D-based 3D viewer plugin work out-of-the-box, since
    people often had trouble installing it manually.  At the time
    when I first made these packages there were no java3d
    packages in Debian, but now that these are in sid we should
    eventually be able to switch to using those.
