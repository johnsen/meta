Task: Medical data
Description: Debian Med suggestions for medical databases
 Currently Debian Med does not yet contain any medical data like drug
 databases.  We just provide a list of Free Software that might be used
 and which might be included into Debian at a later point in time
 provided somebody is willing to take over the packaging work.

Pkg-Description: pharmaceutical reference database
 Important note: The project seems to be dead and the domain drugref.org
 does not exist any more.  Thanks to the GNU Savannah project the code was
 kept for the past but there is no guarantee at all that the project is
 of any use.
 .
 The aim to to allow the collaborative construction of a free,
 peer-reviewed pharmaceutical reference.
 .
 The primary motivation is to support the gnumed project -- a free software
 medical information system, but it may have other uses.
 .
 It will support logging and versioning of all data, changes made by
 contributors can be audited and reverted if necessary. The data can
 be peer-reviewed by several authorities, end-users can opt to have
 only data which is peer-reviewed.
 .
 Drug names, indications, interactions, contra-indications, adverse
 reactions and side-effects are supported. Product information for
 multiple countries can be entered.
