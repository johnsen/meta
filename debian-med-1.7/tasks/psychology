Task: Psychology
Description: Debian Med packages for psychology
 This metapackage contains dependencies for a collection of software
 which might be helpful for psychological research.

Depends: python-pyepl

Depends: praat

Depends: r-cran-foreign, psignifit
Why: analysis packages of particular relevance for psych. data

Depends: r-cran-psy
Remark: r-cran-psy is orphaned upstream.
 Hint to users of statistical psychological software.  This package
 seems to be orphaned upstream.  There are several related packages
 at CRAN for instance.  See the list of prospective packages below
 and drop the Debian Med team a note if you are interested in one
 of them.
 

Depends: psychopy

Depends: visionegg

Pkg-Description: Python library for 2D/3D visual stimulus generation
 The Vision Egg is a programming library that uses standard, inexpensive
 computer graphics cards to produce visual stimuli for vision research
 experiments.

Pkg-Description: Procedures for Psychological, Psychometric, and Personality Research
 A number of routines for personality, psychometrics and experimental
 psychology. Functions are primarily for scale construction using factor
 analysis, cluster analysis and reliability analysis, although others
 provide basic descriptive statistics. Functions for simulating
 particular item and test structures are included. Several functions
 serve as a useful front end for structural equation modeling. Graphical
 displays of path diagrams, factor analysis and structural equation
 models are created using basic graphics. Some of the functions are
 written to support a book on psychometrics as well as publications in
 personality research. For more information, see the
 personality-project.org/r webpage.

Depends: psychometric

Pkg-Description: Applied Psychometric Theory
 Contains functions useful for correlation theory, meta-analysis
 (validity-generalization), reliability, item analysis, inter-rater
 reliability, and classical utility

Pkg-Description: Recursive Partitioning Based on Psychometric Models
 Recursive partitioning based on psychometric models, employing the
 general MOB algorithm (from package party). Currently, only
 Bradley-Terry trees are implemented.

Pkg-Description: Functions for analyzing psychophysical data in R
 An assortment of functions that could be useful in analyzing data from
 pyschophysical experiments. It includes functions for calculating d'
 from several different experimental designs, links for m-alternative
 forced-choice (mafc) data to be used with the binomial family in glm
 (and possibly other contexts) and self-Start functions for estimating
 gamma values for CRT screen calibrations.

Depends: psignifit3
Homepage: http://psignifit.sourceforge.net/
License: MIT
Language: C++, Python
Responsible: Michael Hanke <michael.hanke@gmail.com>
WNPP: 580499
Pkg-Description: fitting and testing hypotheses about psychometric functions
 This package allows fitting of psychometric functions to datasets while
 maintaining full control over a large number of parameters. Psignifit performs
 the calculation of confidence intervals as well as goodness-of-fit tests.
 .
 This is the successor of 'psignifit' a commandline-based toolbox. The new
 version is primarily a python module, but other bindings will be added
 eventually.
