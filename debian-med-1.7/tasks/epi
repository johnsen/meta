Task: Epidemiology
Description: Debian Med epidemiology related packages
 This metapackage will install tools that are useful in epidemiological
 research.  Several packages making use of the GNU R data language for
 statistical investigation.  It might be a good idea to read the paper
 "A short introduction to R for Epidemiology" at

Pkg-Description: network-enabled tools for epidemiology and public health practice
 NetEpi, which is short for "Network-enabled Epidemiology", is a collaborative
 project to create a suite of free, open source software tools for epidemiology
 and public health practice. Anyone with an interest in population health
 epidemiology or public health informatics is encouraged to examine the prototype
 tools and to consider contributing to their further development. Contributions
 which involve formal and/or informal testing of the tools in a wide range of
 circumstances and environments are particularly welcome, as is assistance with
 design, programming and documentation tasks.
 .
 This is a tool for conducting epidemiological analysis of data sets, both large
 and small, either through a Web browser interface, or via a programmatic
 interface. In many respects it is similar to the analysis facilities included
 in the Epi Info suite, except that NetEpi Analysis is designed to be installed
 on servers and accessed remotely via Web browsers, although it can also be
 installed on individual desktop or laptop computers.
 .
 The software was developed by New South Wales Department of Health.

 NetEpi Case Manager is a tool for securely collecting structured
 information about cases and contacts of communicable (and other)
 diseases through Web browsers and the Internet. New data collection
 forms can be designed and deployed quickly by epidemiologists, using a
 "point-and-click" interface, without the need for knowledge of or
 training in any programming language. Data can then be collected from
 users of the system, who can be located anywhere in the world, into a
 centralised database. All that is needed by users of the system is a
 relatively recent Web browser and an Internet connection ("NetEpi"
 is short for "Network-enabled Epidemiology"). In many respects,
 NetEpi Case Manager is like a Web-enabled version of the data entry
 facilities in the very popular Epi Info suite of programmes published by
 the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and in the Danish
 EpiData project, which is available for several languages. The software
 was developed by the Centre for Epidemiology and Research of the New
 South Wales Department of Health, with contributions from Population
 Health Division of the Australian Government Department of Health and
 Ageing.

Pkg-Description: framework for creating agent based simulations
 Repast Simphony is a free and open source agent-based modeling toolkit
 that simplifies model creation and use. Repast Simphony offers users a
 rich variety of features including the following:
  * Fluid model component development using any mixture of Java, Groovy,
    and flowcharts in each project;
  * A pure Java point-and-click model execution environment that includes
    built-in results logging and graphing tools as well as automated
    connections to a variety of optional external tools including the R
    statistics environment, *ORA and Pajek network analysis plugins, A
    live agent SQL query tool plugin, the VisAD scientific visualization
    package, the Weka data mining platform, many popular spreadsheets,
    the MATLAB computational mathematics environment, and the iReport
    visual report designer;
  * An extremely flexible hierarchically nested definition of space
    including the ability to do point-and-click and modeling and
    visualization of 2D environments; 3D environments; networks including
    full integration with the JUNG network modeling library as well as
    Microsoft Excel spreadsheets and UCINET DL file importing; and
    geographical spaces including 2D and 3D Geographical Information
    Systems (GIS) support;
  * A range of data storage "freeze dryers" for model check pointing
    and restoration including XML file storage, text file storage, and
    database storage;
  * A fully concurrent multithreaded discrete event scheduler;
  * Libraries for genetic algorithms, neural networks, regression, random
    number generation, and specialized mathematics;
  * An automated Monte Carlo simulation framework which supports multiple
    modes of model results optimization;
  * Built-in tools for integrating external models;
  * Distributed computing with Terracotta;

Pkg-Description: multi-agent simulation of complex systems
 Swarm is a software package for multi-agent simulation of complex
 systems, originally developed at the Santa Fe Institute. Swarm is
 intended to be a useful tool for researchers in a variety of
 disciplines. The basic architecture of Swarm is the simulation of
 collections of concurrently interacting agents: with this architecture,
 we can implement a large variety of agent based models.
X-Remark: Jakson Alves de Aquino has a guide to installing Swarm 2.2 on Ubuntu and Debian
