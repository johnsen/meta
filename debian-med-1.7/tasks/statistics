Task: Statistics
Description: Debian Med statistics
 This metapackage will install packages which are helpful to do statistics
 with a special focus on tasks in medical care.

Depends: r-cran-qvalue

Depends: r-cran-randomforest

Suggests: science-statistics
Why: This more or less includes all statistics relevant packages which might be
 a bit to much for medical purposes - so it is only suggested.
