Task: Biology
Description: Debian Med micro-biology packages
 This metapackage will install Debian packages related to molecular biology,
 structural biology and bioinformatics for use in life sciences.

X-Begin-Category: Phylogenetic analysis

Depends: altree
Remark: altree 1.1.0 should be not be packaged
 According to Vincent Danjean <vdanjean.ml@free.fr> version 1.1.0 should not
 be packaged for two reasons:
 .
  1. New dependencies (libtamuanova-perl, nanova and libnanova-perl) which
     need to be packaged.
  2. There are still bugs in the new method added in altree 1.1.0 and the doc
     is not updated.
 .
 See http://lists.debian.org/debian-med/2009/08/msg00104.html for further
 details.

         would hide them from the tasks and bugs list as well from the sectioning in
         http://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=debian-med-packaging@lists.alioth.debian.org&ordering=3
         so they are mentioned here in addition to autodocktools.

Pkg-Description: motif discovery and search
 MEME is a tool for discovering motifs in a group of related DNA or protein
 sequences.  A motif is a sequence pattern that occurs repeatedly in a group
 of related protein or DNA sequences. MEME represents motifs as position-dependent
 letter-probability matrices which describe the probability of each possible
 letter at each position in the pattern. Individual MEME motifs do not contain
 gaps. Patterns with variable-length gaps are split by MEME into two or more
 separate motifs.
 .
 MEME takes as input a group of DNA or protein sequences (the training set)
 and outputs as many motifs as requested. MEME uses statistical modeling
 techniques to automatically choose the best width, number of occurrences,
 and description for each motif.

Vcs-Svn: svn://svn.debian.org/svn/debian-med/trunk/packages/tacg/trunk/
Pkg-Description: command line program for finding patterns in nucleic acids
 tacg is a character-based, command line tool for unix-like operating systems
 for pattern-matching in nucleic acids and performing some of the basic protein
 manipulations. It was originally designed for restriction enzyme analysis of
 DNA, but has been extended to other types of matching. It now handles
 degenerate sequence input in a variety of matching approaches, as well as
 patterns with errors, regular expressions and TRANSFAC-formatted matrices.
 .
 It was designed to be a grep for DNA and like the original grep, its
 capabilities have grown so that now the author has to keep calling up the help
 page to figure out which flags (now ~50) mean what. tacg is NOT a GUI
 application in any sense. However, it's existance as a strictly command-line
 tool lends itself well to Webification and wrapping by various GUI tools and
 it is now distributed with a web interface form and a Perl CGI handler.
 Additionally, it can easily be integrated into editors that support shell
 commands such as nedit.
 .
 The use of tacg may be cited as: Mangalam, HJ. (2002) tacg, a grep for DNA.

 treevolve will simulate the evolution of DNA sequences under a
 coalescent model, which allows exponential population growth,
 population subdivision according to an island model, migration and
 recombination. In addition different periods of population dynamics
 can be enforced at different times. For example, a period of
 exponential growth can be followed by a period of stasis where the
 population is subdivided into demes. Multiple sets of such simulated
 sequence data can then be compared to sequence data sampled from a
 population of interest using suitable statistics, and various
 evolutionary hypotheses concerning the evolution of this population
 tested.

License: GPL
Pkg-Description: organize the data associated with a genome
 Developments in genome-wide approaches to biological research have
 yielded greatly increased quantities of data, necessitating the cooperation
 of communities of scientists focusing on shared sets of data. ASAP
 leverages the internet and database technologies to meet these needs.
 ASAP is designed to organize the data associated with a genome from the
 early stages of sequence annotation through genetic and biochemical
 characterization, providing a vehicle for ongoing updates of the annotation
 and a repository for genome-scale experimental data. Development was
 motivated by the need to more directly involve a greater community of
 researchers, with their collective expertise, in keeping the genome
 annotation current and to provide a synergistic link between up-to-date
 annotation and functional genomic data. The system is continually under
 development at the Genome Evolution Lab with the stable, in-use, publicly
 available University of Wisconsin installation updated regularly.
 .
 Software development on ASAP began in early 2002, and ASAP has been
 continually improved up until the present day. A longstanding goal of
 the ASAP project was to make the source code of ASAP available so that
 other installations of ASAP could be implemented. As future ASAP
 installations come to pass, ASAP will be further extended to be
 inter-operable between sites.

 improvement consists of the k-means algorithm, which now includes
 multiple trials to find the best clustering solution. This is crucial
 for the k-means algorithm to be reliable. The routine for self-organizing
 maps was extended to include 2D rectangular geometries. The Euclidean
 distance and the city-block distance were added to the available
 measures of similarity.

 Ngila is an application that will find the best alignment of a pair
 of sequences using log-affine gap costs, which are the most
 biologically realistic gap costs.
 .
 Ngila implements the Miller and Myers (1988) algorithm in order to
 find a least costly global alignment of two sequences given homology
 costs and a gap cost. Two versions of the algorithm are
 included: holistic and divide-and-conquer. The former is faster but
 the latter utilizes less memory. Ngila starts with the
 divide-and-conquer method but switches to the holistic method for
 subsequences smaller than a user-established threshold. This improves
 its speed without substantially increasing memory requirements. Ngila
 also allows users to assign costs to end gaps that are smaller than
 costs for internal gaps. This is important for aligning using the
 free-end-gap method.

 ROSE is a program which identifies regions between two genomes which

 two multi fasta files of DNA sequences. The PROmer program from the
 MUMmer package needs to be run first between the two genomes, and the
 resulting delta file is then input to ROSE. If a previous annotation
 is available for one or both genomes, then the coordinates of the
 annotated genes from a genome can be optionally given as input in a
 gff file. The gene coordinates will be used to guide the length of
 the regions produced by ROSE. By default, when finding a region of
 consistent alignments, ROSE will add a user-defined margin (1000 bp
 by default) on either side of that region. When a predicted gene
 overlaps an alignment we use the gene prediction to extend the
 boundaries of the output region.

Pkg-Description: phylogenetic generalized hidden Markov model for predicting alternatively spliced exons
 ExAlt is a software program designed to predict alternatively spliced
 overlapping exons in genomic sequence. The program works in several
 ways depending on the available input. ExAlt can use information of
 existing gene structure as well as sequence conservation to improve
 the precision of it's predictions. ExAlt can also make predictions
 when only a single genomic sequence is available. ExAlt has been
 extensively tested on Drosophila melanogaster, but can be adapted to
 run on other species.

 faster and more powerfull than SMILE which is described itself as
 "SMILE is a tool that infers motifs in a set of sequences, according
 to some criterias. It was first made to infer exceptionnal sites as
 binding sites in DNA sequences. It allows to infer motifs written on
 any alphabet (even degenerate) in any kind of sequences.  The
 specificity of SMILE is to allow  to deal with what we call
 "structured motifs",  which are motifs associated by some distance
 constraints. In particular, SMILE is able to group under a unique
 model different occurrences composed of several boxes separated by
 spacers of different lengths."

 The reference to SMILE is made here especially because there is some
 work done in the Debian Med SVN at

Pkg-Description: High-throughput sequence alignment using Graphics Processing Units
 The recent availability of new, less expensive high-throughput DNA
 sequencing technologies has yielded a dramatic increase in the volume
 of sequence data that must be analyzed. These data are being
 generated for several purposes, including genotyping, genome
 resequencing, metagenomics, and de novo genome assembly
 projects. Sequence alignment programs such as MUMmer have proven
 essential for analysis of these data, but researchers will need ever
 faster, high-throughput alignment tools running on inexpensive
 hardware to keep up with new sequence technologies.
 .
 MUMmerGPU is a low cost, ultra-fast sequence alignment program
 designed to handle the increasing volume of data produced by new,
 high-throughput sequencing technologies. MUMmerGPU is a GPGPU drop-in
 replacement for MUMmer, using the GPUs in common workstations to
 simultaneously align multiple query sequences against a single
 reference sequence stored as a suffix tree. By processing the queries
 in parallel on the highly parallel graphics card, MUMmerGPU achieves
 more than a 10-fold speedup over a serial CPU version of the sequence
 alignment kernel, and outperforms MUMmer on a high end CPU by
 3.5-fold in total application time when aligning reads from recent
 sequencing projects using Solexa/Illumina, 454, and Sanger sequencing
 technologies.

Pkg-Description: comparative genome assembly package
 A comparative assembler is a program that can assemble a set of
 shotgun reads from an organism by mapping them to the finished
 sequence of a related organism. Thus, a comparative assembler
 transforms the traditional overlap-layout-consensus approach to
 alignment-layout-consensus. The AMOScmp package uses the MUMmer
 program to perform a mapping of the reads to the reference genome,
 then processes the alignment results with a sophisticated layout
 program designed to take into account polymorphisms between the two
 genomes. For a detailed description of the algorithms involved please
 refer to the paper listed in the References section.
 .
 AMOScmp uses as AMOS messages as both the inputs and the outputs (see

Pkg-Description: Transcript Annotation Prioritization and Screening System
 TrAPSS stands for Transcript Annotation Prioritization and Screening
 System. It is a system comprised of several tools written by
 researchers at the Coordinated Lab for Computational Genomics in the
 University of Iowa. The system aims to aid scientists who are
 searching for the genetic mutation or mutations that are linked to
 expression of a disease phentotype. The system offers support for
 almost all areas of a mutation discovery project from the creation
 and prioritization of a large candidate gene list, to the selection,
 ordering, and managing of primer pairs, and even support for SSCP
 assay results. TrAPSS is a currently deployed and often used tool for
 several laboratories here at the University of Iowa in the College of
 Medicine. The system is composed of several Java applications, many
 web-based PHP tools, and a local MySQL database. Even the Java
 applications are available through a web browser due to Sun's Java
 Web Start. Director of the CLCG, Professor Terry A. Braun, heads the
 project along with Dr. Todd Scheetz and Prof. Thomas
 L. Casavant. Eight developers create and maintain the software:
 Bartley Brown , Hakeem Almabrazi, Steven Davis and Jason Grundstad;
 along with three graduate students, Brian O'Leary, John Ritchison and
 Michael Smith; and one undergraduate student, Matthew Kemp.
 Importance of TrAPSS
 .
 The true importance of TrAPSS is that it is based upon a novel way to
 examine a large candidate list of genes. Rather than sequentially
 examining full genes, the scheme often followed in current target
 identification projects, TrAPSS provides tools that offer the user
 the opportunity to screen certain small parts of several genes from
 the candidate list at once. This "parallel" screening idea was
 envisioned by researchers here at the University of Iowa including
 Dr. Edwin Stone and Prof. Thomas L. Casavant. Research by graduate
 students Steven Davis and Brian O'Leary has demonstrated the
 advantage of the parallel screening method over the sequential
 sequencing of large candidate lists.

 Comparison of complete microbial genomes reveals a large number of
 conserved gene clusters - sets of genes that have the same order in
 two or more different genomes. Such gene clusters often, but not
 always represent a co-transcribed unit, or operon. A method was
 developed to detect and analyze conserved gene pairs - pairs of genes
 that are located close on the same DNA strand in two or more
 bacterial genomes. For each conserved gene pair, an estimate of
 probability is calculated that the genes belong to the same
 operon. The algorithm takes into account several alternative
 possibilities. One is that functionally unrelated genes may have the
 same order due simply because they were adjacent in a common
 ancestor. Other possibilities are that genes may be adjacent in two
 genomes by chance alone, or due to horizontal transfer of the gene
 pair.

Pkg-Description: quality-control checking of finished cDNA clone sequences
 cdna_db is a software system designed for quality-control checking of
 finished cDNA clone sequences, and their computational analysis. The
 combination of a relational db (MySQL) schema, and an
 object-orientated perl API make it easy to implement high-level
 analyses of these transcript sequences.
 .
 The cdna_db can store cDNA clone sequences, and ESTs and
 consensus/contig sequences also derived from these clones. These are
 then used by the system to check cDNA clone sequence identity etc
 (see deneral_doc.txt). For each clone multiple DNA sequence versions
 can be stored, if for instance, the finished DNA sequence is revised
 as part of the sequencing process.
 .
 A blast pipeline is implemented together with a job control system
 (with LSF underlying) so that multiple CPUs can be used in parallel
 to carry out the blasts of large datasets. The searches can be made
 incremental, so as more cDNA sequences are added to the databank,
 just the new clones are blasted.
 .
 Utility scripts are provided to delete previous search results, and
 dump cDNA clones sequences (such as those that passed the QC
 checking) from the cdna_db.

Pkg-Description: lightweight Distributed Annotation System (DAS) server
 The Distributed Annotation System (DAS) is a data exchange protocol
 for open sharing of biological information.
 .
 ProServer is a very lightweight DAS server written in Perl. It is
 simple to install and configure and has existing adaptors for a wide
 variety of data sources. It is also easily extensible allowing
 adaptors to be written for other data sources. More information about
 the DAS protocol and what it is useful for is available over at
 http://biodas.org.
 .
 New large scale techniques in biology are producing a rapidly growing
 amount of public available data. Centralized database resources are
 confronted with the task how to scale their storage facilities, how
 to manage frequent updates and how to exchange the data with the
 community.
 .
 The Distributed Annotation System (DAS) addresses these issues. It is
 frequently being used to openly exchange biological annotations
 between distributed sites. Data distribution, performed by DAS
 servers, is separated from visualization, which is done by DAS
 clients.
 .
 DAS is a client-server system in which a client like Ensembl
 integrates information from multiple servers. It allows a single
 machine to gather up genome annotation information from multiple
 distant web sites, collate the information, and display it to the
 user in a single view. Little coordination is needed among the
 various information providers.
 .
 DAS is heavily used in the genome bioinformatics community. Over the
 last years we have also seen growing acceptance in the protein
 sequence and structure communities.

 The est_db package is a software suite and database system designed
 to support expressed sequence tag (EST) sequencing projects, and to
 provide comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of sequenced EST
 libraries, for gene discovery and other purposes. The database can
 hold and efficiently process hundreds of thousands of EST sequences,
 track the cDNA libraries and clones to which they belong, and store
 the results of their analysis. Should they be available, large
 compute farms can be used for the analysis.
 .
 Extensive bioinformatic analysis can be carried out on the sequenced
 EST libraries, including similarity (BLAST) searches, protein
 sequence prediction, and the import of EST clustering and assembly
 data from external sources. Results are searchable via a web page,
 with graphic output of the various analyses, enabling one to retrieve
 information pertaining to a particular cDNA clone, or EST read, as
 well as view EST clustering results, or graphical representations of
 BLAST results on the searched EST sequences.
 .
 The est_db package is likely to appeal not only to sequencing groups
 directly employed in EST sequencing, but also to groups interested in
 performing bespoke analysis of ESTs that may already be publically
 available, in order to support their ongoing research aims. The
 package is easily-extensible, via an API designed specifically to
 handle ESTs and their analysis. It is open source and is made
 available free of charge, and, where possible, similarly
 open-licensed components have been used in its development.

Pkg-Description: scan DNA sequences to look for likely coding regions
 Hexamer is a program to scan DNA sequences to look for likely coding
 regions. The principle is to use 6mers, but to avoid deriving any
 information from base composition. Therefore, the frequencies of each
 6mer are normalized by dividing by the total frequency of all 6mers
 with the same base composition.
 .
 There are two programs involved in this process:
  * hextable
    hextable makes files of statistics that hexamer uses to scan for
    likely coding regions.
    The input of hextable is a fasta file of coding sequences in
    frame.  The -o file output is an ascii list of 4096 floating point
    numbers giving log likelihood ratio scores in bits.  The output on
    stdout is a summary of the information content of the table,
    indicating how disriminative it is likely to be.
  * hexamer
    Uses the .hex file from hextable to scan a DNA sequence for likely
    coding regions.
    The input is a fasta DNA file (n.b. that these programs assume all
    'a','c','g','t'. 'n's found in the sequence files will be

 Profile Hidden Markov Models (pHMMs) are a widely used tool for
 protein family research. We present a method to visualize all of
 their central aspects graphically, thus generalizing the concept of
 sequence logos introduced by Schneider and Stephens. For each
 emitting state of the pHMM, we display a stack of letters. As for
 sequence logos, the stack height is determined by the deviation of
 the position's letter emission frequencies from the background
 frequencies of the letters. As a new feature, the stack width now
 visualizes both the probability of reaching the state (the hitting
 probability) and the expected number of letters the state emits
 during a pass through the model (the expected contribution).

Pkg-Description: suite of programs designed to quickly group sequences.
 CD-HIT stands for Cluster Database at High Identity with
 Tolerance. The program (cd-hit) takes a fasta format sequence
 database as input and produces a set of 'non-redundant' (nr)
 representative sequences as output. In addition cd-hit outputs a
 cluster file, documenting the sequence 'groupies' for each nr
 sequence representative. The idea is to reduce the overall size of
 the database without removing any sequence information by only
 removing 'redundant' (or highly similar) sequences. This is why the
 resulting database is called non-redundant (nr). Essentially, cd-hit
 produces a set of closely related protein families from a given fasta
 sequence database.
 .
 CD-HIT uses a 'longest sequence first' list removal algorithm to
 remove sequences above a certain identity threshold. Additionally the
 algorithm implements a very fast heuristic to find high identity
 segments between sequences, and so can avoid many costly full
 alignments.
 .
 With recent developments, cd-hit package offers new programs for DNA
 sequence clustering and comparing two databases. It also has lots of
 new options for clustering control.

Pkg-Description: detailed comparison of two sequences
 Dotter is a graphical dotplot program for detailed comparison of two
 sequences.  Here, every residue in one sequence is compared to every
 residue in the other sequence. The first sequence runs along the
 x-axis and the second sequence along the y-axis. In regions where the
 two sequences are similar to each other, a row of high scores will
 run diagonally across the dot matrix. If you're comparing a sequence
 against itself to find internal repeats, you'll notice that the main
 diagonal scores maximally, since it's the 100% perfect self-match.
 .
 To make the score matrix more intelligible, the pairwise scores are
 averaged over a sliding window which runs diagonally. The averaged
 score matrix forms a three-dimensional landscape, with the two
 sequences in two dimensions and the height of the peaks in the
 third. This landscape is projected onto two dimensions by aid of
 greyscales - the darker grey of a peak, the higher it is.
 .

 .
 EST-ferret is a user-configurable, automated pipeline for the

 range of sequence and annotation databases, including Gene Ontology
 and Conserved Domain Database to deliver a putative identity and a
 detailed annotation of each clone. It can be run either step-by-step
 to track the outputs, or as a single batch process. Users can easily
 edit the configuration file to define parameter settings.
 .
 This package has five major components: (1) ESTs coding system; (2)
 sequence processing; (3) sequence clustering; (4) sequence annotating
 and (5) storage and reporting of results. DNA trace files are renamed
 and converted into FASTA format, cleaned and submitted to
 dbEST(Boguski, et al, 1993). Sequence assembly uses two rounds of
 CAP3 to assemble the ESTs into groups corresponding to separate gene
 families and unique genes. Sequence identification and annotation is
 provided by a series of BLAST homology searches (Parallel_BLAST and
 Priority_BLAST) against user-defined sequence databases implemented
 with the NCBI BLASTALL algorithm. The BLAST results are parsed and
 annotation terms that reflect functional attributes are captured from
 Gene Ontology (The Gene Ontology Consortium, 2000), KEGG and Enzyme
 Commission (EC) databases and applied to each of the clones. CDD (and
 InterPro) searches are performed for seeking protein domains in the
 sequences. Other options are provided to run PatSearch, RepeatMasker
 and BLAT to find UTRs, repeats and EST candidates in
 genomes. Finally, the package generates analysis reports in a variety
 of flat file formats, sources of which can be serve as inputs for
 some gene annotation and gene expression profiling tools, and also as
 a MySQL database or web-browsable search tool.

 ESTScan is a program that can detect coding regions in DNA sequences,
 even if they are of low quality. It will also detect and correct
 sequencing errors that lead to fr ameshifts.
 .
 ESTScan is not a gene prediction program, nor is it an open reading
 frame detector. In fact, its strength lies in the fact that it does
 not require an open reading frame to detect a coding region. As a
 result, the program may miss a few translated amino acids at either
 the N or the C terminus, but will detect coding regions with high
 selectivity and sensitivity.
 .
 Similarly to GENSCAN, ESTScan uses a Markov model to represent the
 bias in hexanucleotide usage found in coding regions relative to
 non-coding regions. Additionally, ESTScan allows insertions and
 deletions when these improve the coding region statistics. Further
 details can be found at:

 sensitivity for similarity searching at high speed. This is achieved
 by performing optimised searches for local alignments using a
 substitution matrix. The high speed of this program is achieved by
 using the observed pattern of word hits to identify potential matches
 before attempting the more time consuming optimised search. The
 trade-off between speed and sensitivity is controlled by the ktup
 parameter, which specifies the size of the word. Increasing the ktup
 decreases the number of background hits. Not every word hit is

 (TIGR, now the J. Craig Venter Institute), and it has been used here
 for several years to clean sequence data from automated DNA
 sequencers prior to sequence assembly and other downstream uses.  The
 quality trimming portion of lucy makes use of phred quality scores,
 such as those produced by many automated sequencers based on the
 Sanger sequencing method.  As such, lucy’s quality trimming may not
 be appropriate for sequence data produced by some of the new
 “next-generation” sequencers.

Pkg-Description: help biologists analyze comparative data about organisms
 Mesquite is software for evolutionary biology, designed to help
 biologists analyze comparative data about organisms. Its emphasis is
 on phylogenetic analysis, but some of its modules concern population
 genetics, while others do non-phylogenetic multivariate
 analysis. Because it is modular, the analyses available depend on the
 modules installed. Analyses include:
  * Reconstruction of ancestral states (parsimony, likelihood)
  * Tests of process of character evolution, including correlation
  * Analysis of speciation and extinction rates
  * Simulation of character evolution (categorical, DNA, continuous)
  * Parametric bootstrapping (integration with programs such as PAUP*
    and NONA)
  * Morphometrics (PCA, CVA, geometric morphometrics)
  * Coalescence (simulations, other calculations)
  * Tree comparisons and simulations (tree similarity, Markov
    speciation models)
 There is a brief outline of features, which includes
 screenshots. Mesquite is not primarily designed to infer phylogenetic
 trees, but rather for diverse analyses using already inferred trees.

Pkg-Description: Probabilistic Alignment Kit for DNA, codon and amino-acid sequences
 PRANK is a probabilistic multiple alignment program for DNA, codon
 and amino-acid sequences. It's based on a novel algorithm that treats
 insertions correctly and avoids over-estimation of the number of
 deletion events. In addition, PRANK borrows ideas from maximum
 likelihood methods used in phylogenetics and correctly takes into
 account the evolutionary distances between sequences. Lastly, PRANK
 allows for defining a potential structure for sequences to be aligned
 and then, simultaneously with the alignment, predicts the locations
 of structural units in the sequences.
 .
 PRANK is a command-line program for Unix-style environments but the
 same sequence alignment engine is implemented in the graphical
 program PRANKSTER. In addition to providing a user-friendly interface
 to those not familiar with Unix systems, PRANKSTER is an alignment
 browser for alignments saved in the HSAML format. The novel format
 allows for storing all the information generated by the aligner and
 the alignment browser is a convenient way to analyse and manipulate
 the data.
 .
 PRANK aims at an evolutionarily correct sequence alignment and often
 the result looks different from ones generated with other alignment
 methods. There are, however, cases where the different look is caused
 by violations of the method's assumptions. To understand why things
 may go wrong and how to avoid that, read this explanation of
 differences between PRANK and traditional progressive alignment
 methods.

Pkg-Description: Analyzing and Visualizing Evolutionary Data
 Evolutionary data is most often presented as a phylogentic tree, the
 underlying assumption being that evolution is a branching
 process. However, real data is never ideal and thus doesn't always
 support a unique tree, but often supports more than one possible
 tree. Hence, it makes sense to consider tree reconstruction methods
 that produce a tree, if the given data heavily favors one tree over
 all others, but otherwise produces a more general graph that
 indicates different possible phylogenies. One such method is the
 Split Decomposition introduced by Hans-Juergen Bandelt and Andreas
 Dress (1992) and its variations. Another example is Spectral Analysis
 developed by Hendy, Penny and others.

Pkg-Description: heuristic computer program to identify prophage regions within bacterial genomes
 It uses tab-delimited results from NCBI BLASTALL or WU BLASTP 2.0 searches against a
 collection of bacteriophage protein sequences and results from HMMSEARCH analysis of
 441 phage-specific HMMs to locate prophage regions. By using FASTA33, MUMMER  or BLASTN,
 it can find potential attachment (att) sites of the phage region(s). Data from tRNAscan-SE
 and Aragorn  are used to determine whether a tRNA  or tmRNA  served as the putative target
 for integration. Additionally, by looking for the presence or absence of specific proteins
 using specific HMM models, Phage_Finder can predict whether the region is most likely
 prophage and which type (Mu, P2, or retron R73), an integrated element, a plasmid, or a
 degenerate phage region.
 .
 The goal of this project is to provide an open-sourced, standardized and automated system
 to identify and classify prophages within prokaryotic genomes. It is hoped that this package
 will facilitate future studies on the biology and evolution of these prophages by providing
 a level of microbial genome annotation that was previously void.

Pkg-Description: explore and quantify relationships between clustering results
 CompClust is a python package written using the pyMLX and IPlot APIs. It provides
 software tools to explore and quantify relationships between clustering results. Its
 development has been largely built around needs of microarray data analysis but could
 be easily used in other domains.
 .
 Briefly pyMLX provides for efficient and convenient execution of many clustering
 algorithms using a extendable library of algorithms. It also provides many-to-many
 linkages between data features and annotations (such as cluster labels, gene names,
 gene ontology information, etc.) These linkages persist through varied data
 manipulations. IPlot provides an abstraction of the plotting process in which any
 arbitrary feature or derived feature of the data can be projected onto any feature
 of the plot, including the X,Y coordinates of points, marker symbol, marker size,
 maker/line color, etc. These plots are intrinsically linked to the dataset, the
 View and the Labeling classes found within pyMLX.

Pkg-Description: Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology
 QIIME (canonically pronounced ‘Chime’) is a pipeline for performing
 microbial community analysis that integrates many third party tools which
 have become standard in the field. A standard QIIME analysis begins with
 sequence data from one or more sequencing platforms, including Sanger,
 Roche/454, and Illumina GAIIx. With all the underlying tools installed,
 of which not all are yet available in Debian (or any other Linux
 distribution), QIIME can perform library de-multiplexing and quality
 filtering; denoising with PyroNoise; OTU and representative set picking
 with uclust, cdhit, mothur, BLAST, or other tools; taxonomy assignment
 with BLAST or the RDP classifier; sequence alignment with PyNAST, muscle,
 infernal, or other tools; phylogeny reconstruction with FastTree, raxml,
 clearcut, or other tools; alpha diversity and rarefaction, including
 visualization of results, using over 20 metrics including Phylogenetic
 Diversity, chao1, and observed species; beta diversity and rarefaction,
 including visualization of results, using over 25 metrics including
 weighted and unweighted UniFrac, Euclidean distance, and Bray-Curtis;
 summarization and visualization of taxonomic composition of samples
 using pie charts and histograms; and many other features.
 .
 QIIME includes parallelization capabilities for many of the
 computationally intensive steps. By default, these are configured to
 utilize a mutli-core environment, and are easily configured to run in
 a cluster environment. QIIME is built in Python using the open-source
 PyCogent toolkit. It makes extensive use of unit tests, and is highly
 modular to facilitate custom analyses.

Pkg-Description: Rapid denoising of pyrosequencing amplicon data
 To denoise pyrosequencing amplicon data, the package exploits the
 rank-abundance distribution.  PyroNoise uses an expectation maximization
 (EM) algorithm to figure out the most likely sequence for every read. We,
 instead, use a greedy scheme that can be seen as an approximation to
 PyroNoise. According to several test data sets, the approximation gives
 very similar results in a fraction of the time.
